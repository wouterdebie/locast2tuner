### Mandatory configuration
username = "my_locast@username"
password = "very_secret_password"

### Optional configuration

## Address of the interface to bind to. The default value is 127.0.0.1 (localhost). To bind to all
## interfaces, use 0.0.0.0
# bind_address = "127.0.0.1"

## What zip codes to override. By default this is not set and locast2tuner will use your external IP
## to determine your location.
#
# Please see https://www.locast.org/dma for a current map of the supported regions
#
#override_zipcodes = ["98101","94102","90210","85006","80019","57701","57103","51054","55111","75001","77002","60018","46077","30301","33602","33125","33403","20002","21206","19103","18505","10009","02115","53558","32789","28102","95605","44102","43016","48201","53202","97086","00909","27545","37660","15120"]

## How many days of EPG data to fetch. The default is 8, which is the maximum of data locast.org provides
# days = 8

## Verbosity. 0 = Info, 1 = Info + HTTP request lgos, 2 = Debug, 3 = Trace.
## In error logs, you might see "run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace".
## Setting the verbosity to 2 or 3 will also include the backtrace.
# verbose = 1

## Enable RUST_BACKTRACE=1. In error logs, you might see "run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable
## to display a backtrace". Instead of adding the environment variable, you can enable this behavior with
## rust_backtrace.
# rust_backtrace = false

## TCP port to bind to. The default is 6077. In case you override muliple zip codes, locast2tuner will
## bind to multiple ports, starting at the number specified below (or default 6077). Any additional
## instance will bind to a port incremented by 1. E.g. if you override 3 zip codes, 3 instances will
## be started and bound to 6077, 6078 and 6079. In order to only use one instance, use "multiplex"
## (see below).
# port = 6077

## The amount of tuners that is communicated to Plex. This will limit the amount of streams that Plex will
## allow. Note that this is not a limitation in locast2tuner.
# tuner_count = 3

## Disable caching of station information. By default locast2tuner caches station information for an hour
## (see cache_timeout below). By disabling the cache, every request for station information will lead
## to a call to locast.org. Normally you shouldn't have to disable the cache.
# disable_station_cache = false

## How often (in seconds) the station cache is refreshed.
# cache_timeout = 3600

## Where to save station data
# cache_dir = "/var/lib/locast2tuner" # default: $HOME/.locast2tuner

## Normally, when you override multiple zip codes, locast2tuner starts multiple instances (see "bind_address"),
## but with "multiplex = true", stations from multiple locations will be available through a single instance.
# multiplex = false

## Remap channel numbers when multiplexing. In case you override multiple zip codes, Emby and Plex will sort
## channels by channel number, which means channels from different locations might be intermingled. In order
## circumvent this, you can use "remap = true". This causes locast2tuner to rewrite the channel number based
## on the amount of instances there are. Locast will remap a "channel_number" to
## "channel_number + 100 * instance_number", where the instance_number starts at 0.
## E.g. you override 3 zip codes, then the channels from the first location will be untouched (since 100*0 == 0),
## the stations for the second location will start at 100 (e.g. 2.1 CBS becomes 102.1 CBS) and the stations
## for the third location will start at 200 (e.g. 13.2 WWFF becomes 213.2 WWFF).
##
## Another mutually exclusive way of remapping appears below. Please only specify one option, but if you do
## use both, then "remap" will take precedence.
# remap = false

## Remap channels based off a JSON definition file. You specify a JSON file containing your remappings. 
## To get your current mappings, you can go to "http://PORT:IP/map.json". Copy that content to a JSON 
## file (you'll want to pretty it up too to make it easier to work with) and you can edit that JSON file, 
## save it, and then use this option to load those remappings the next time you run locast2tuner. You 
## will need to restart locast2tuner in order to see any changes you made (and you may need to recreate 
## your tuner/EPG setup to have Plex or Emby reflect the right channels). ***NOTE*** This is currently 
## a manual edit process, so if you want to go this route, please be sure that the JSON content is valid 
## JSON before trying to use it. A web-based remap editor is in the works.
# remap_file = "remap.json"

## Device firmware that is reported to Plex or Emby. Defaults to "homerun3_atsc"
# device_firmware = "homerun3_atsc"

## Device model that is reported to Plex or Emby. Defaults to "HDHR3-US"
# device_model = "HDHR3-US"

## Device version that is reported to Plex or Emby. Defaults to "20170612"
# device_version = "20170612"

## Don't log anything to the terminal
# quiet = false

## Log through syslogd
# syslog = false

## Log to a specific file. By default locast2tuner will not log to a file.
# logfile = "locast2tuner.log"
